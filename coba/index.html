    <p>
We are happy to announce that Novel's doors are finally open for browsing!


BUT.

There are rules, of course:

1. We are asking that everyone who comes in wear a mask.

2. We are asking that you limit your stay to about 45 minutes.

***We still welcome (and encourage!) curbside pickup and online orders!***

Libro's dining room is also open again at 50% capacity and properly distanced - please use their entrance on the patio if you are coming to dine in. Call (901) 800-2656 for more details.

See you soon!
